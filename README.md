# Diabetes-Patient-Readmission-Hyperparameter-Database-


The data we will be working with is
readmission of diabetic patientâ€™s data. The
outcome is focused on the management of
hyperglycemia in patients that are
hospitalized. This factor has an important
bearing in terms of morbidity and mortality.
In the dataset, we will see the impact of
various clinical practices in readmission rates.
The dataset constitutes the clinical care at
130 hospitals and coherent networks in the
US for the last 10 years(1999-2008). Multiple
features are included such as outcomes of
patient and hospital. Information was
extracted from the databases for situations
that satisfied the following criteria :
1) If the hospital admission is an
inpatient encounter.
2) If it is a diabetic encounter. The type
of diagnosis which was entered.
3) If the length of the patient's stay was
at least 1 day and at most 14 days.
4) if during the encounter Laboratory
tests were carried out.
5) If medications were doctored during
the encounter.
